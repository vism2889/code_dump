<h1>Assignment 5: Site Analysis</h1>

  <li>The type of site organization featured in Figure 2.30 is hierarchical organization.  I would say that this type of organization
  is most appropriate for the Java Jam webpages.  Despite their being pitfalls associated with hierarchical organization
   (being overly shallow or deep), that doesnt appear to be the case in Figure 2.30.  I do find linear organization to
   be an effective method also, though in the java jam case the different menu options are not as realted as per say the lessons
   in a tutorial where there is a sequencial progression, again reaffirming my intital statement, that the current hierarchical
   layout in Figure 2.30 is the best option.
<br><br>
   <li>Reviewing the web design best practices checklist to evaluate the Java Jam sites that have been created up until this point
   Three best practices that were made good use of were: All the <cite>Navigation</cite> checks, specifically that all my hyperinks work which crosses over
   with a check under the <cite>Functionality</cite> checks section.  The <cite>Color and Graphics</cite> have been fairly minimal in good way, in addition to
   using colors that contrast and/or comliment each other well. Many of the <cite>Page Layout</cite> checks have also been followed through with
   fairly well: informative page title, page footer with with copyright and email adress, home pages dont use many images
   and load quickly, ect.  In terms of some Best practices that could be implemented better, I dont think <cite>Browser Compatibility</cite> has been taken into account much
  (by me personally,i cant speak for other students in this class, we have covered a lot of methods to improve this in this section though.) In addition to
  browser compataility not being taken into account by me personally, i haven't dont much in terms of making any of my cites extra-accessible.  I do think that
  <cite>Accessability</cite> is very important, and would like to use the methods i have learned to implement alternate text/font replacement, breadcrumbs navaigation possibly,
  and including alternative text replacements for images.  I would also like to go over the grammar and spelling of everything, because the text editor i use
  does not have built in checks to catch those errors.
