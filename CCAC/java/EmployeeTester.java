   "Chapter 10 Programming challenge #13"
   
   The challenge:
   Design a class named Employee. The class should keep the following information in fields:
   • Employee name 
   • Employee number in the format XXX–L, where each X is a digit within the range 0–9 
     and the L is a letter within the range A–M. 
   • Hire date Write one or more constructors and the appropriate accessor and mutator 
     methods for the class. 
     
  Next, write a class named ProductionWorker that extends the Employee class. The ProductionWorker 
  class should have fields to hold the following information: 
  • Shift (an integer) 
  • Hourly pay rate (a double) The workday is divided into two shifts: day and night. 
    The shift field will be an integer value representing the shift that the employee works. 
    The day shift is shift 1 and the night shift is shift 2. 
  
  Write one or more constructors and the appropriate accessor and mutator methods for the class. 
  Demonstrate the classes by writing a program that uses a ProductionWorker object.
